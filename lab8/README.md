This Lab is intended as practice for the creation of Shiny Apps. This directory contains the app.R script which makes the shiny app and Advertising.csv which is the data used by the shiny app. This data contains information about Sales with advertising budgets. The shiny app allows the user to select a type of advertising budget and creates a scatterplot with the selected type and sales.
