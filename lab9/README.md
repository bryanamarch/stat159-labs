This lab was created for the purposes of stat 159 taught at UCB. This serves as a learning opportunity of Latex and Rnw files. In this lab, lab 9, we reproduced a simple linear regression anaylsis report. In this file we have the Rnw report, lab9.Rnw, the scatterplot image, scatterplot-tv-sales.png, the RData file with regression information, regression.RData, and finally the generated pdf report, lab9.pdf.
